# Marine Data Platform Documentation Index

## 📚 Complete Documentation Suite

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Marine Data Platform. This documentation is designed to help developers at all levels understand, contribute to, and deploy this marine biodiversity analysis platform.

## 🎯 Documentation Overview

### For New Developers
**Start here if you're new to the project**

1. **[Main README](../README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
2. **[Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Complete setup and development workflow
3. **[Frontend Architecture](FRONTEND.md)** - React/TypeScript frontend deep dive
4. **[Backend Architecture](BACKEND.md)** - FastAPI Python backend guide

### For Advanced Users
**Detailed technical documentation**

5. **[API Integration](API_INTEGRATION.md)** - External API integrations (OBIS, Gemini)
6. **[Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Production deployment (Vercel + Render)

## 🔥 Critical Issue Fixed

### AI Analysis Now Uses Real Data
**Problem**: AI analysis was showing "no actual data" despite datasets having millions of records.

**Solution**: The `obisGeminiService.ts` was completely refactored to fetch both dataset metadata AND actual occurrence records.

**Key Changes**:
- Added `fetchDatasetOccurrences()` method
- Modified `analyzeDatasetWithAI()` to use real species data
- Enhanced AI prompts for meaningful analysis
- Fixed data flow from OBIS API to Gemini AI

**Impact**: AI now provides scientifically accurate analysis based on real marine species occurrence data.
